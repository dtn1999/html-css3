:neutral_face: as you will have probably saw the project was just to illustrate the basic of HTL5(using semantic tag) and CSS3. so the following features will be added in the future

- [ ] Make the site responsive (this time using bootstrap)
- [ ] Implement some animations using just css3 :yum: (it will be a bit challenging)
